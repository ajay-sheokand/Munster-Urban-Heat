## Key Visualization Parameters

### MODIS LST Color Scale (Dynamic Range)
The Land Surface Temperature visualization uses an **adaptive color scale** that automatically adjusts to the actual temperature range in the data:

- **Dynamic Min/Max Calculation**: The app analyzes actual LST values to determine the optimal color range
- **10% Buffer**: Adds padding above and below the data range for better visualization
- **Real-time Display**: Shows the actual temperature range being visualized (e.g., "LST Range: 18.5°C to 25.3°C")

**Color Palette** (Blue → Red gradient):
- **Blue tones**: Coolest areas (lower range)
- **Cyan/Light Blue**: Cool-moderate areas
- **Yellow**: Moderate temperatures (mid-range)
- **Orange**: Warm areas
- **Red tones**: Hottest areas (upper range)

This dynamic approach ensures optimal color distribution regardless of season or weather conditions, making temperature variations clearly visible across all Delhi districts.

## Analysis Methodology

### Multi-Variable Correlation Analysis

The dashboard implements a comprehensive statistical analysis to understand the relationships between vegetation (NDVI), temperature (LST), and land use patterns (LULC):

**1. Data Sampling:**
- Collects 500 random sample points across Delhi districts
- Each point contains: LST value, NDVI value, and Land Cover classification
- Spatial resolution: 500m (balanced between detail and processing speed)
- Temporal averaging: Mean values over selected date range

**2. Statistical Calculations:**
- **Pearson Correlation**: Measures linear relationship between NDVI and LST
- **Area Coverage**: Percentage of study area for each land cover type
- **Temperature Statistics**: Mean, standard deviation, min/max by land use type
- **Urban Heat Island Intensity**: Temperature difference between built-up and vegetated areas

**3. Visualizations:**
- **Pie Chart**: Land cover distribution by area
- **Bar Chart**: Area coverage colored by temperature to show impact
- **Scatter Plot**: NDVI vs LST with trend line and area-weighted markers
- **Box Plots**: Temperature distribution within each land cover category

**4. Automated Insights:**
The system analyzes results to identify:
- Dominant land cover types (by area)
- Strength of vegetation cooling effect (correlation coefficient)
- Urban heat island magnitude
- Temperature extremes and their spatial extent
- Total vegetation coverage and adequacy

**5. Recommendations:**
Data-driven strategies generated based on:
- Areas with high temperature and low vegetation
- Land use types with highest thermal impact
- Cooling potential of different interventions

This evidence-based approach helps urban planners and policymakers make informed decisions about heat mitigation strategies.

### NDVI Color Scale
- **Red/Brown**: Low vegetation (NDVI < 0.2)
- **Yellow/Light Green**: Sparse vegetation (NDVI 0.2-0.4)
- **Green**: Moderate vegetation (NDVI 0.4-0.6)
- **Dark Green**: Dense vegetation (NDVI > 0.6)

### Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) Colors
Based on ESA WorldCover 2021 classification:
- **Dark Green** (#006400): Tree Cover
- **Orange-Yellow** (#FFBB22): Shrubland
- **Light Yellow** (#FFFF4C): Grassland
- **Pink-Purple** (#F096FF): Cropland
- **Red** (#FA0000): Built-up/Urban Areas
- **Gray** (#B4B4B4): Bare/Sparse Vegetation
- **White** (#F0F0F0): Snow/Ice
- **Blue** (#0064C8): Permanent Water Bodies
- **Cyan** (#0096A0): Herbaceous Wetland

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: "Import 'streamlit' could not be resolved"**
- Solution: Ensure virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed
  ```powershell
  .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

**Error: "Error fetching time series data"**
- Solution: Check GEE credentials and ensure service account has Earth Engine access
- Verify the service account JSON file path is correct

**Map not centering on Delhi**
- Solution: Verify zoom_start parameter is set to 10 (city-level zoom)
- Check that delhi_admin.geojson file exists

**No MODIS data available**
- Solution: Check date range selection and ensure data exists for the period
- MODIS data availability: 2000 - Present
- Try selecting a more recent date range

**LST layer showing single color**
- Solution: This is fixed with dynamic color scaling. If issue persists, check that Earth Engine is calculating min/max properly
- Verify the data range is displayed in the info message

**District boundaries not loading**
- Solution: Ensure delhi_admin.geojson exists in the project root
- Check that geopandas is installed correctly
- Verify file permissions

**Correlation analysis showing no data**
- Solution: 
  - Ensure date range has sufficient MODIS data
  - Try a longer date range (at least 7-14 days)
  - Check that Earth Engine sampling completed successfully

**Deployment errors on Streamlit Cloud**
- Solution:
  - Verify all secrets are configured (OPENWEATHER_API_KEY, GEE credentials)
  - Ensure delhi_admin.geojson is committed to repository
  - Check that packages.txt is NOT present (causes GDAL conflicts)
  - Verify runtime.txt specifies compatible Python version

**LULC legend not visible**
- Solution: The legend is fixed position in lower-right corner. Try scrolling or zooming the page
- On mobile, it may overlap with other elements - this is expected

**Responsive design issues on mobile**
- Solution: 
  - Use landscape orientation for better view
  - Zoom out to see full width of charts
  - Tables are horizontally scrollable
